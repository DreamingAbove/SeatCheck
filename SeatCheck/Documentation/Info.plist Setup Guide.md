# Info.plist Setup Guide for SeatCheck

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues to Fix

The app is crashing due to missing Info.plist configurations. Follow these steps to fix the issues:

Add this to your Info.plist:

```xml
<key>NSApplicationSupportDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>SeatCheck needs to create a directory to store your session data and settings.</string>

The app is trying to use background location without proper configuration.

### Required Info.plist Entries:

```xml

<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>location</string>
    <string>background-processing</string>
</array>
```

## 3. Motion & Fitness

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>SeatCheck uses motion data to detect when you're moving and help determine if you've left your seat.</string>
```

## 4. Camera Access

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>SeatCheck needs camera access to help you scan your seat area for forgotten items.</string>
```

## 5. Bluetooth Access

## How to Add These to Your Xcode Project

1. **Open your Xcode project**
2. **Select your project in the navigator**
3. **Select your target**
4. **Go to the "Info" tab**
5. **Add the keys and values above**

## Alternative: Add Programmatically

If you prefer to add these programmatically, you can add them to your project's build settings or create a custom Info.plist file.

## Testing After Changes

After adding these entries:

1. **Clean your project** (Product â†’ Clean Build Folder)
2. **Delete the app from simulator/device**
3. **Build and run again**

The Core Data and location issues should be resolved!

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:

1. **Check that all keys are properly formatted**
2. **Ensure no typos in the key names**
3. **Verify the app has proper entitlements**
4. **Check that background modes are enabled in capabilities**

## Next Steps

After fixing the Info.plist:

1. âœ… **Core Data will work properly**
2. âœ… **Location services will function correctly**
3. âœ… **Background processing will be available**
4. âœ… **All permissions will be properly requested**

The app should now run without crashes! ðŸŽ‰
